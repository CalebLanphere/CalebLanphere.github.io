        <div id="aboutMeParagraphs">
            <p class="aboutMeParagraph">Hello, I'm Caleb Lanphere, a sophomore computer science at St. Bonaventure University in New York.
            I have been self-teaching myself programming on and off since I was twelve. Since starting university,
            I have drastically improved my skills and found the focus I want to spend the rest of my life
            working towards.</p>
            <p class="aboutMeParagraph">From middle through High School, I had big dreams, but did not have the skills to back up such
            adventures. I started but failed to finished multiple projects throughout 2018-2024, with two being
            completed and released. When starting my bachelors program, I gained enough skills to produce complete
            programs and released my first, from scratch, instant messenger using Java titled TextMe</p>
            <p id="finalAboutMeParagraph">I am thriving with the structured learning and I plan on releasing more programs throughout my time
            at St. Bonaventure and throughout the rest of my career.</p>

                <p>A lab for User Experience Design that had us pick a dataset and create two sets of visualizations for different groups. The first one being "persuasive" (Designed for those who do not have the time and cannot read a chart), and "clear" (Designed for those who have the time and can read a chart).</p>
                <p>My partner and I took a dataset named <a class="projectInTextLink" target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvasoundankar/gen-ai-misinformation-detection-datase-20242025"><i>Gen AI Misinformation Detection Data (2024-2025)</i></a> and created four charts using the program <i>Tableau™</i>. One of those charts show the correlation between toxicity scores of posts against the reliability score of the sources used to verify that post. The other measured the percentage of who wrote a post per platform, split into non-misinformaton and misinformation. It also included a percentage of posts labeled as misinformation from users and a percentage of posts labeled as misinformation in the dataset.</p>

                <p>My partner and I took a few pages from the <i>Internet Archive™</i>'s site and recreated them to work better for mobile screens. These pages included the home page, search and advanced search pages, the blog page, and the content viewer modal.</p>
                <p>These designs took into account the differences in navigation, precision, and general expectations that exist on mobile devices to make the service feel professional and flow properly for a mobile device. It not only repositioned and resized components, but merged the advanced and regular search pages into a dropdown in the main page and recreated the content viewer modal to allow for normal mobile mappings to apply with books, music, videos, and other content.</p>

                <p>A lab for User Experience Design that used information gained previously in our conducted interviews to create sketches for a product that could solve problems noticed throughout the interviews.</p>
                <p>Throughout my interviews, I noticed a trend of incorrect information misleading the people interviewed on ranging scales. This gave me the idea to sketch out a software that would make information invisible or change based on "expiration dates"</p>
                <p>The product would be customizable and have open APIs for usage from other companies and sites with limited modification. This would allow any site to implement their own way to handle expired data. For example, a news site could use it to hide sections of an article if a trustworthy source could not be found within a certain time frame</p>

            <p>TextMe is an instant messenger created using Java. This program follows a server/client architecture and has no user accounts. The program uses the Advanced Encryption Standard and the RSA standard for encrypting the messages sent through the platform. The server stores messages in memory, meaning when the server closes, the message log is erased.</p>
